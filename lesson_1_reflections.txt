we can use diff from command line and file1 and file2 also required
With version control and having entire history of a document probably the most valuable feature what we need
Pros of having manaul version control: you can create a logical set of commitable things, cons: easy to forget
Why some version control systems like Git allows saving multiple files in one commit while others don't allow it? - Because sometimes we need multiple files in one project and all the files are the same. Other systems are not developer systems.
To start to see the versions you can enter to Bash: git log, if you want to check the ids of different versions
By typing git diff id1 id2 - you will get the differences.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? - now I am more relaxed on this - we can find the problem anytime
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? - Now I want to start a project and save versions
